# patient-health-trend-analysis
## Objective
To analyze and visualize patient health metrics, such as blood pressure, glucose levels, or heart rate, over time to detect patterns, correlations, or anomalies. This helps healthcare providers make data-driven decisions for personalized care.

## Implementation
1. Data Source
 - Patient records containing health metrics over time, stored in CSV files or databases like SQL.

2. Libraries Used
 - Matplotlib: For creating clear and static plots.
 - Plotly: For generating interactive visualizations that enable deeper exploration.

3. Types of Visualizations
 - Line Charts: Show changes in individual metrics (e.g., blood pressure) over time.
 - Heatmaps: Illustrate correlations between multiple metrics (e.g., glucose levels vs. blood pressure).
 - Boxplots: Highlight outliers in health data that may indicate anomalies.

## Expected Outcome
By implementing the above steps, healthcare providers can:
 - Identify patterns and trends in patient health metrics.
 - Detect anomalies for proactive medical intervention.
 - Enhance understanding of correlations between different health parameters.
